      <title>Distributed Algorithms for Machine Learning </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Distribued learning algorithms work with the system formed by a group of computational nodes, each of which can locally store the data and pass the message in the system. The goal of these algorithm is to train a global learning model based on all nodesâ€™ data through local computation and neighboring communication. Current distributed learning methods suffer from 1) high sample complexity due to the large local datasets; 2) inefficient communication caused by the low network bandwidth and complex model structure; 3) significant loss of data privacy when untrustable nodes exist; 4) unstable performance due to the asynchronous and byzantine nodes. Our work focuses on designing decentralized algorithms that can overcome these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We build up the R package &amp;ldquo;FlightScanner&amp;rdquo; for Web scraping/crawling flight information from SkyScanner API (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skyscanner.com/%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.skyscanner.com/)&lt;/a&gt;. This package can Keep track of flight price and help us choose best flights whie save money without spending too much time on searching.&lt;/p&gt;
