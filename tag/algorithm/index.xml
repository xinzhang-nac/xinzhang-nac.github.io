      <description>&lt;p&gt;Distribued learning algorithms work with the system formed by a group of computational nodes, each of which can locally store the data and pass the message in the system. The goal of these algorithm is to train a global learning model based on all nodesâ€™ data through local computation and neighboring communication. Current distributed learning methods suffer from 1) high sample complexity due to the large local datasets; 2) inefficient communication caused by the low network bandwidth and complex model structure; 3) significant loss of data privacy when untrustable nodes exist; 4) unstable performance due to the asynchronous and byzantine nodes. Our work focuses on designing decentralized algorithms that can overcome these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
